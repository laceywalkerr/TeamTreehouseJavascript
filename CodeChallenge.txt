Evaluate the code in app.js. The code currently produces a TypeError. 
Adjust the code so that the points variable holds the expected value.

const points = 100;
const bonusPts = 50;

points += bonusPts;
console.log(points);

Answer: const wont work here, use "var" instead.

The following produces an Uncaught SyntaxError:
    let numberToGuess = 5;
    let numberToGuess = 20;
    console.log(numberToGuess);

The following do not cause an Uncaught SyntaxError:
    var numberToGuess = 5;
    var numberToGuess = 20;
    console.log(numberToGuess);

    var numberToGuess = 5;
    numberToGuess += 3;
    console.log(numberToGuess);

    let numberToGuess = 5;
    numberToGuess += 3;
    console.log(numberToGuess);

    It's best not to use the const keyword in which of the following variable declarations:
    A variable used to track a players score.

    A player's score changes during a game, so a constant is not the best choice for a variable whose value changes.
    Good examples for a variable would be a users name, a tax rate, or a greeting.
    Remember that variables defined as constants can't have their value reassigned.
