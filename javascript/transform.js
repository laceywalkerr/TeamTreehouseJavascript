// here's a fun trick! want to know the ammount of characters in a string? try this
const passphrase = 'Open Season';
console.log(passphrase.length);
// the number 11 would appear in your console, as it counts all the characters in the string
// the use of this could be for passwords that must reach a certain amount of characters, or to make sure a required input field is not 0
// strings are treated as objects
// ( you can access the property of an object using a dot ".")

// Here's a couple of cool methods!
toUppercase()
// converts a string to all uppercase letters
toLowercase()
// similarly, this would convert a string to all lowercase letters

const passphrase = 'I Have Spoken';
console.log(passphrase.toLowerCase());
