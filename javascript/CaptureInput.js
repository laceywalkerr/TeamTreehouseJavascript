// we use prompt to ask the user a question, or prompt a user to input some text. Much like an alert method, only there is a text field.
prompt("What is your name?");

// prompt returns a value, so whatever the user's input. Here we are storing it in a variable, and returning the input in the form of an alert.
const name = prompt("What is your name?");
alert(name);

// generally you would use a field form to capture a users imput, but this is another way to do that.
